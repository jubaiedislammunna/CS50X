# Description:This project aims to create a tool for students to improve their typing speed and accuracy. It offers customizable levels to cater to different skill sets and encourage progression, while also promoting familiarity with word spellings. The application's structure includes a CSS directory with base.css for foundational styles and game.css for the game interface. The JS directory houses counter.js for common functions, level.js for level selection, words.js for word storage, and core.js for core functionality such as level processing, word retrieval, timing, scoring, and additional features. Key features include customizable levels, word display for typing, timing and scoring, and anti-cheating measures such as disabling text pasting and word selection. Future plans include a leaderboard to track progress, foster motivation through competition, and display scores in words per minute (WPM).I'm deeply grateful to CS50 for transforming code from a foreign language into a flowing poem. It unlocked doors I never thought possible, building confidence, fostering creativity, and connecting me with a passionate coding community. My Bangladeshi heart is filled with gratitude for this transformative journey.This project aims to create a tool for students to improve their typing speed and accuracy.
